# Windows Challenge

This challenge is designed to be solved in Windows, but feel free to tackle it on any platform. That’s the true essence of reverse engineering—adapting and solving across environments!

For this kind of challenge, it is easier to use Binary Ninja. But, IDA Free and x64dbg is also a very good debugger. But if you love the classic tools, go for Ghidra and IDA Free combination. 
Choose you own weapon! For me, I'll gonna use all of it in the beginning, then for deep debugging purposes, I always use x64dbg.

The purpose is not to get the flag, but to understand the logic, debug it, and get the secret-key.

How to run (please use command prompt):
```
C:\your-path> crackme01.exe put-the-secret-key
```
