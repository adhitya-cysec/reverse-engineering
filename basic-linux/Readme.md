# Linux Challenge

This challenge is designed to be solved in Linux, but feel free to tackle it on any platform. That’s the true essence of reverse engineering—adapting and solving across environments!

This challenge can be easily analyzed using tools like IDA Free, Binary Ninja, or GDB. Choose your weapon!

The purpose is not to get the flag, but to understand the logic, debug it, and get the secret-key.

How to run:
`
chmod +x crackme01                           # 02, 03, 0x etc
./crackme01 put-the-secret-key
`
